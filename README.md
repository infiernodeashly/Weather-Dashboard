# Weather-Dashboard

This application will allow you to search for a city and be returned with the city name, the date, an icon for the weather, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index, along with a 5-day weather forecast. 

The Open Weather API was used for this project, so it does not allow you to search by state, although there is a way to search via state code. 
'Event' is being deprecated, so I will need to learn what to use now, instead.

The user inputs the city name and country code, then selects the search icon or presses enter.

The weather and additional details are displayed, along with a 5-day forecast. It will also continue to add your searched locations to a list on the left.

If the system cannot find the city entered, it will return an error message.
